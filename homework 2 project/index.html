            I served as an active duty Marine for a little over 9 years as an Intelligence Analyst.
            I deployed to different locations around the world including Iraq. This experience 
            allowed me to work in multiple environments, and gave me the experience to lead many diverse teams,
            which has made it my best learning experience so far. It you want to see a Marine Corps video that
            still pulls at my heart strings, <b>please check it out below!</b>

        <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>I'm about to graduate with my bachelors degree in Computer Science from the 
            <em>University of California, San Diego</em> (UC San Diego). After I graduate,
            I'll continue my education here at UCSD and pursue my masters in Computer Science, where I'll 
            get to learn some more cool things! If you want to see the three coolest things I've learned so far,
            please check out my top three below!
        </p>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>The top three coolest things I've learned so far are: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How a single core CPU works going all the way down to the 
                    transistor level.
                </li>
                <li>How operating systems are vastly more complex than I had originally imagined.</li>
                <li>How to view problems/solutions from a hardware and software perspective.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>I want to use technology to help people! I want to be a software engineer that works 
            on large scale applications that help society in some way!
